Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
Frippery was a bootcamp project aiming to follow the CRUD methodology. We created an air bnb clone that allows users to either rent costumes or list them through a MVC architecture. 
We created Frippery because it was fun, but also because it solved a particular problems- clothing wastage, time, money and hassle. By creating Frippery, we aimed to reduce clothing wastage and also help people save time, money and hassle renting a fancy dress costume that they may never use again. 
As a seller, you could create, update and destroy a listing
as a renter you could read a listing and make a purchase

We had 5 days to design and implement this. We used Figma to design look and wireframe. We used trello to keep track of what was being done and we wr=ere all able to work on front and back end design. 

We ran out of time during the challenge, so could not complete the application as we would have liked. We prioritised making it functional rather than how it looked.
